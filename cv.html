                <p>I have a wealth of experience in developing commercial and health and social care technical solutions using
                    my IT skills on the Salesforce Platform. I have developed a number of custom concepts for customers ranging
                    from single users to complex multi organisation systems with over 200 users. I am a keen to use and enhance
                    my skills to build solutions and solve problems that benefit the business and the end user. I am able
                    to work well as part of a team. I enjoy taking on projects-based work and I have good communication and
                    presentation skills.

                - I worked for a Salesforce company known as PSIAMS Systems, which supplied CRM development and support across the West Midlands
                and beyond. I managed over 250 users across 20 different organisations, each with their own complex needs
                and requirements on how the system should run. I also did research on new features for the system at the
                request of the users. This would involve anything from basic app market research to fresh ideas tested in
                sandboxes with basic apex and visual-force. The best example of this was creating a pdf generator for the
                charity known as Forward Carers which not only allowed them to massively cut back on the amount of paper
                they were using, but also created a better way of working for their team.
            </div>
            <div class="key key-2">- While working for Ginger6 I created the company a database system which was designed to replace their paper-based
                invoice system. This saved them thousands of pounds a month in waste disposal and paper costs.
